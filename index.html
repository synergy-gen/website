                <p>
                    Synergen (short for “Synergy Generator”) is not your typical goal tracking app. It creates an
                    environment where users can thrive off the collective energy of others as they accomplish their
                    goals. Not only can users create goals, but they can also adopt goals shared by others as their own
                    and join groups of other users working towards the same goal. This ability to search through the
                    productive creations of users and participate in them sets Synergen apart. With the power of a
                    social network to facilitate goal-setting and goal-getting, your dreams are now within reach.
                </p>
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Existing mobile applications for goal tracking focus on the individual - there is no network
                    associated with the goals you create. This leaves everyone with a mindset of “you’re on your own”
                    when it comes to setting and accomplishing their goals. Shouldn’t there be a way for users to
                    create, share, and adopt goals in a wonderfully simple and beautiful way? Welcome Synergen, bringing
                    you together so that nothing is impossible.
                </p>
